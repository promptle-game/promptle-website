    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>
    Promptle is a web game similar to Wordle but with AI implemented into it to address the limitation that 
    Wordle games have. They are hard coded topics that come from a hard set database meaning there is only 
    so many topics, guesses, and answers. We address this problem by implemention AI through OpenAI's API 
    to dynamically create puzzles based on a topic the user inputs. Our project will have a login system with profiles, 
    popuar topics, AI prompt generated games, and multiplayer. It will also includee a variety of other games 
    following the idea of using AI and letting the user choose the topic to allow unlimited and unique games.
